4.) Open the htdocs folder in the xampp folder. Copy and paste this repository.

5.) Open the browser (chrome), type localhost and you should see the index page of the website.

6 .) to login as a docter or a personnel you have to manually add credentials into the logindocter and perlogin tables from the database.this is for security because we cannot just allow anybody to register an account as a doctor or personnel.
